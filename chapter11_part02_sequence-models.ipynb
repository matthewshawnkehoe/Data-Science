        "These past few examples clearly show that <font color='blue'>word order matters</font>: manual engineering of order-based features, such as bigrams, yields a nice <font color='blue'>accuracy boost</font>. Now remember: the history of deep learning is that of a move away from manual feature engineering, toward letting models learn their own features from exposure to data alone. What if, instead of manually crafting order-based features, we exposed the model to raw word sequences and let it figure out such features on its own? This is what <font color='blue'>sequence models</font> are about.\n",

Then, you'd <font color='blue'>map each integer</font> to a <font color='blue'>vector</font> to obtain vector sequences. Finally, you'd feed these sequences of vectors into a stack of layers that could cross-correlate features from adjacent vectors, such as a 1D convnet, a RNN, or a Transformer.\n",

However, nowadays sequence modeling is almost universally done with Transformers, which we will cover shortly. Oddly, one-dimensional convnets were never very popular in NLP, even though, in my own experience, a residual stack of depthwise-separable 1D convolutions can often achieve comparable performance to a bidirectional LSTM, at a greatly reduced computational cost."

Also, there is no such a thing as <font color='blue'>human language</font>—there are many different languages, and they aren't isomorphic to one another, because a language is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific context. But more pragmatically, what makes a good word-embedding space depends heavily on your task: the perfect word-embedding space for an English-language movie-review sentiment-analysis model may look different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language legal-document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",
